# Movie_Ticket_Booking_In_C
The "Movie Ticket Booking System" is a software project developed in the C programming language to streamline the process of booking and managing movie tickets. With the advancement of technology, traditional ticket booking methods have become outdated and inconvenient. This project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution by automating the ticket booking process.

The Movie Ticket Booking System allows users to view the availability of seats, book tickets, cancel bookings, and view the list of booked tickets. It utilizes file handling techniques to store and retrieve seat information, ensuring the persistence of data even after program restarts. By incorporating file handling, the system maintains an up-to-date record of seat statuses, customer details, and ticket prices.

The project offers a menu-driven interface, enabling users to navigate through different functionalities effortlessly. Users can check the availability of seats in real-time, select their desired seats, provide their personal information, and complete the booking process. Additionally, the system allows users to cancel their bookings if necessary, freeing up seats for other customers.

To enhance flexibility, the Movie Ticket Booking System provides the functionality to specify the ticket prices before selling them. This feature allows cinema operators to adjust ticket prices based on factors such as movie popularity, showtime, and seat category.

The project employs fundamental concepts of C programming, such as data structures, file handling, loops, conditional statements, and user input/output. By implementing these concepts, the system ensures efficient seat management, data storage, and retrieval.

Overall, the Movie Ticket Booking System simplifies and automates the movie ticket booking process, providing a convenient and user-friendly platform for customers. It improves the efficiency of cinema operations, enhances the overall movie-going experience, and eliminates the hassle of manual ticket booking.
